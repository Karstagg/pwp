# This website will serve as a web based business card



## Milestone 1 Feedback
"Electronic business card" is a great way to describe what you're going for on the final site. Your Audience and Purpose are very clearly specified, and your Goal is very focused on earning you a job. Great job with this section. Throughout development of the site, be sure to think of how to make your website stand out to employers over other possible hires, but also still have all the required data to make you a good choice. I'm sure you can figure this out considering the work I've seen you do before. 

Your Persona is done very well. It goes into great detail on who Johan is and why he would want to hire a junior developer. I also wanna give you some praise for mentioning all of the different methods that employers use to view possible candidates - github, social media, resumes, and websites. Great job! 

Your Use Case is also very well done - although it would have been nice if you went into more detail on WHY he called you next day. Sure, he looked at your site, but what stood out to him? What, in your eyes, is the thing that really caught his attention and made him decide to give you a call over all the other candidates? Think about this as you proceed with development.


### Edits &amp; Suggestions 
- When you create a new php file in PhpStorm, it will create those annoying timestamp comments at the top of your code. They have no use, so delete them so your code looks better. (or just select create a file and end the name with .php, that avoids this and lets you create any type of file without having to be specific.)



Overall, fantastic job! You've passed in tier IV - the best you can do. You are free to move on into milestone 2a (which I see you've already done.)
